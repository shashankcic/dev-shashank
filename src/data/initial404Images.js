    errText: 'You thought this mission to the moon would be a quick six month thing. Your neighbor offered to look after your dog. Your high school math teacher was impressed. He once said you wouldn’t amount to anything.You sure showed him. But now here you are, fifty feet from your spaceship with no way to get back. Your dog will be so sad. Your math teacher will be so smug. Pretty devastating.',

    errText: 'The child had looked so excited when the clown had presented a large red balloon. You had seen this, but in the throes of your morning commute you didn’t register it until it was too late. Who asked the government to support a fair right through Main Street during a week day anyway? Your bike barrelled right between the child and the clown and sent the balloon on its merry way. You didn’t turn back to see the damage you had done. Later you saw the balloon floating outside your office window.',

As you cling on to the bouey the coast guard had thrown at you, you watch the water rush into you beloved dingy. The leak sprays water higher and higher.

    errTitle: 'This Page is Broken',
    errText: 'A broken clock is right twice a day. But if you just have one clock, it’s impossible to tell exactly when the clock is right. So it could be right at any moment. And that brings you to the crux of the conceptualization. What is time? Nothing but an abyss. Clocks are just false attempts to harness its power. It’s cruel really.',

You take out your laundry. You fold your underwear. You think about folding your socks. You remember your toast! It is too late. It’s burnt to a crisp. The process repeats itself. You should probably figure out your toasting settings.',

    errText: 'The earthquake was not good to the bike lane on your way to work. A large gap in the pavement (too big to be called a pothole) had swallowed three oblivious bikers whole. So the city had put up two pylons and yellow caution tape. Pretty frustrating for you given your propensity to do 360 jumps over the gap.',
